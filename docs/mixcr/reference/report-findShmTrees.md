# `findShmTrees` report

MiXCR generates a comprehensive summary of search for trees process. Find trees reports may be generated right along with [`findShmTrees`](./mixcr-findShmTrees.md) command using `-r`/`--report` for `txt` report and `-j/--json-report` for report in a json format, or can be exported using [`exportReports`](./mixcr-exportReports.md) command.

`Step N: ...`
: Summary of step result. `Clones was added:` - how many clones was added to any tree, `Trees created:` - how many trees was created on this step, `Trees combined:` - how many trees was combined.

`Total trees count`
: Total count of trees found by command.

`Total clones count in trees`
: How many uniq clones included in found trees.

`stepResults`
: Stats for every step. `step` - name and parameters of step, `clonesWasAdded` - count of uniq clones that was added, `cloneNodesWasAdded` - count of clones that are uniq by target sequence (tree structure doesn't distinct C genes and sample names, that clones will be on the same node), `treesCountDelta` - change of tree count, `commonVJMutationsCounts` - stats of VJ mutations count of MRCA, `clonesCountInTrees` - stats of clones count, `wildcardsScore` - stats of wildcards in NDN (average for every tree), `wildcardsScoreForRoots` - stats of wildcards in NDN (for MRCA nodes), `maxNDNsWildcardsScoreInTree` - stats of wildcards in NDN (max for every tree), `surenessOfDecisions` - stats of main metric that used on this step
